    <h2>Front Wing</h2>
  
    <p>The front wing is one of the most important aerodynamic components of a Formula 1 car. It generates downforce and affects the airflow to the rest of the car, particularly the rear wing, the floor, and the tires.</p>
    
    <div class="front-wing-details">
      <div class="front-wing-text">
        <h3>Role and Function</h3>
        <p>The front wing is primarily responsible for generating downforce, which improves the car's grip on the track. It helps in cornering by increasing tire contact with the track and plays a crucial role in the car's overall aerodynamic efficiency.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div class="front-wing-text">
        <h3>Design Evolution</h3>
        <p>The design of the front wing has evolved over the years, with changes to its shape and material aimed at improving aerodynamic efficiency. Modern front wings are complex structures made from lightweight materials, with flaps and elements to direct airflow precisely.</p>

    </div>
  
    <div class="front-wing-details">
      <div class="front-wing-text">
        <h3>Impact on Handling</h3>
        <p>The front wing plays a key role in how the car handles on the track. A well-balanced front wing helps the driver maintain control, especially when navigating sharp corners, while a poorly balanced one can cause instability.</p>
